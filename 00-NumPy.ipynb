    "## Introduction to NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (short for Numerical Python) was created in 2005 by merging Numarray into Numeric. Since then, the open source NumPy library has evolved into an essential library for scientific computing in Python. It has become a building block of many other scientific libraries, such as SciPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes NumPy so useful is that it provides a convenient Python interface for working with multi-dimensional array data structures efficiently. The NumPy array data structure is also called `ndarray`, which is short for *n*-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being mostly implemented in C and using Python as a \"glue language\", the main reason why NumPy is so efficient for numerical computations is that NumPy arrays use contiguous blocks of memory that can be efficiently cached by CPI. In contrast, Python lists are arrays of pointers to objects in random locations in memory, which cannot be easily cached and come a more expensive memory look-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the computational efficiency and low-memory footprint come at a cost: NumPy arrays have a fixed size and are homogeneous, which means that elements must have the same type. Homogenous `ndarray` objects have the advantage of using a C execution backend and avoiding expensive type checks and other overheads of the Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "While adding and removing elements from the end of a Python list is very efficient, altering the size of a NumPy array is very expensive since it requires the creation of a new array & carrying over the contents of the old array that we want to expand or shrink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being more efficient for numerical computations that native Python code, NumPy can also be more elegant and readable due to vectorized operations and broadcasting, which are features that we will cover in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, today NumPy forms the basis of the scientific Python computing ecosystem."
